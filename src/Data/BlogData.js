    body: "You don't want to be that girl who says, 'I only have male friends' that sounds like you are such a pick me. Having female friends or girlfriends is a gift that should never be taken for granted. Your girlfriends are with you through whatever you go through, but like everything in this world, the friendship will die of neglect if you don't nurture or appreciate it. Knowing the unwritten rules of the girl code will help you have better relationships with the women in your life. 1. Never fight over a man you both just me If you all see an attractive man, neither should pursue him or fight over him. Worse, pursue him discreetly without the others knowing. If the man indicates interest in one of you, let the person he likes be with him. You should not think, 'If I can't have him, no one can.' Remember, girls, men are not the price. 2. Never date your friend's ex. The general rule is this, never date your friend's ex except you are absolutely in love with him, and you guys are serious about a relationship. If you do date him, don't expect her to be fine with it. You have to choose between the man and your friend. Never casually sleep with your friend's ex. It's so wrong. If they just dated casually, then you can ask her permission first if you just want to sleep with him or date him. Anyways, it makes you look shady, avoid it together. 3. Be on standby when she's going through a breakup- Immediately your friend tells you about a breakup, drop everything and rush to be with her. She will ramble on and on with different stories, sometimes repetitive, sometimes full of tears. She will curse him out many times. You have to support her throughout, hate the guy as much as she does and makes her feel better. Take her out when she feels up to it and cheer her up, tell her, 'He is no good, they are many better men out there.' Prop up her self-esteem by telling her she is the most beautiful and amazing person ever. 4. Notify her when you are out on a date or sleeping over at a man's place. For security reasons, let her know where you are going. If you meet a new man and you are spending the night at his place, tell her about it. Plus, be available for updates on how the date is going. You need to be in on all the full gist. 5. Hook your friend up with places to get nice clothes, shoes, bags and makeup. What are friends for if not to help each other look fabulous? Did you just find a cheap Instagram vendor or know a place to get beautiful thrifted clothes? Have you discovered a new skincare hack? Then, let your girlfriends know. It makes no sense to be the only one slaying.",

    body: "What to expect when you are not expecting...We asked five young single women what they would do if they found out that they were suddenly pregnant. -The gist-With cryptic pregnancy in vogue and nights of reckless passion common, what would you do if you found out you were pregnant? It wasn't a scare, you are actually pregnant.  some women were asked how they would navigate the news of their pregnancy. -Suzie-'Even though I would be shocked if it happens, I will keep the baby. My father already told me that in my culture, if I perform an abortion, I'll die. I'd rather not die so, I will keep the baby.' -Daniella-'Right now, I'm ready for a baby, if my man is not ready for a baby and I am, I will keep it even if he doesn't want it. If I wasn't mentally prepared for a baby, I could consider abortion or giving the baby out.' -Lola-'I never want to be pregnant even if I'm married so if I get pregnant right now, I'm aborting it immediately. I just can't imagine myself going through the rigours of pregnancy, all the body changes, taking care of a baby...eww.' -Dami-'I love children, but with the current economic situation, I'm not sure I'll keep them. I saw a woman on a bus with her crying baby, and it broke me. I want my kids to have a better life than I did, and I'm not ready financially.Even though I have spiritual obligations, except God tells me to keep it, I won't keep the baby.' -Amara-'I think it depends on with whom I get pregnant. There are some men I can never think of having a child with- like a one-night stand. If it means hitting myself on the floor to get rid of the pregnancy, then I will.' Even though abortions are illegal in Nigeria- it's a crime - women are undeterred in performing them, despite religious and cultural restraints.",

    body: "Nigeria's general elections begin on February 25, 2023. Since the 2019 elections, about 20 million Nigerians have turned 18 and are now eligible to vote. While every Nigerian citizen has the right to vote, logistical obstacles can prevent them from exercising it. One of the most important steps in the voting process can be taken right now, though, and that's obtaining a Permanent Voters Card (PVC). Voters must present a PVC issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Election Day in order to participate in the voting process. In previous elections, PVC registration was an arduous process that required people to queue for days. Now, any Nigerian citizen with access to the internet can register a PVC by themselves online as INEC has launched an online portal for this purpose. Other than registering for a new PVC, voters can also use the site to transfer their cards to a different state or request a card to be reissued. The online PVC registration, which started in June 2021, has a deadline of June 30, 2022. As of May 12, 2022; more than 16 million people have registered. However, INEC chairman Mahmud Yakubu revealed in April that around 45% of these registrations were declared invalid due to incomplete data and wrong or multiple registrations. In some regions, the chairman added, that percentage was as high as 60%. To ensure a validated registration, follow the 5 simple steps below to register for your PVC online. Step 1: Visit the INEC website.The first step on how to register your PVC online is to go to the INEC registration portal and select 'Get Started'. You will be taken to a new page with a list of services. Click on 'New Voter Pre-registration'. Note: This option is only for people who have never registered their PVC before. There are other options on the site if your card is lost, or if you want to buy update your information for a new card. Before we proceed further, know that you can only register once. Wait for confirmation after submitting your application, and do not make any attempt to register again after that-otherwise, you risk invalidating your registration, because signing up multiple times is considered a crime. Step 2: Create a portal account or login. Before proceeding to the registration form, you will be required to sign in to your portal account or create one. Fill in your name, email address, phone number, and create a password, then click 'Submit'. It is important to only use an email address you have access to, as you will receive an email instantly to verify your account. If you can't find the email, it might have gone to your spam folder. In your email app, you should find mail from INEC CVR Portal. Open it and click on the link contained in it to return to the sign-in page you encountered earlier. This time, click on 'Log In' and enter your email and the password you just created. After that, you will be directed to a Declaration page that wants to confirm that all information you will provide is accurate. Ensure to click on 'Yes' before proceeding. Step 3: Register- After the Declaration page, you will be taken to the main registration form. The information required for the form is as follows: Biodata: name, date of birth, gender, occupation, address, NIN, and nationality.Additional information: level of education, disability, maiden name. Residence: country of residence, state of residence, LGA or city of residence. Birth information: country of birth, state of birth, LGA or city of birth. Origin information: country of origin, state of origin, LGA or city of residence, place of origin (town or village) Polling unit: This is information about the state, local government and area you want to vote in. At the bottom of the page, you will find space for supporting documents like your national identity card or passport. Although this step is not mandatory, it facilitates the verification process by making it easy to confirm your identity. It also enables INEC to link your profile on their database to other databases. After you have this, click 'Save and Continue', and you'll be led to a fresh page with confirmation that your application has successfully been updated. If you do not get this confirmation, click on the three black lines in the top right corner of your screen to view your application status.",

      "'The person you are tapping from her blessings might be sleeping with dogs to make money' - Nigerian Catholic priest advises people to take pride in honest labour",

    body: "Malawi-based Nigerian Catholic priest, Fr. Kelvin Ugwu has urged people to be proud of whatever they make an honest living from. Taking to Facebook, he wrote; 'The person you are envious of and tapping from her blessings because you saw her driving a Range Rover car might be sleeping with dogs to make money.' The lady you are jealous of and asking God questions on why he is yet to bless you with estates and money might be a scammer like Ovaioza The guy that everybody in your village is hailing, the one that brought G-wagon to the village, the same person you are wishing to even be his house boy because of the money he kept spraying in any event he is invited to might be a ritualist or an Internet fraudster. You don't need to envy anyone or be jealous of anyone on this street. Don't look down on your self and your labour simply because other people are posting pictures of being in posh places. Take pride in your sincere and upright labour no matter how little the income might be. As Galatians 6:4 says: but everyone is to examine his own achievements, and then he will confine his boasting to his own achievements, not comparing them with anybody else's.",

    body: "The federal government has declared May 2 and May 3 as public holidays to mark the 2022 Workers' Day and Eid-Al-Fitr celebration, respectively. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, announced the development in a statement issued on Thursday by Shuaib Belgore, permanent secretary, ministry of interior. According to the statement, Aregbesola commended workers across the country for their 'hard work, diligence and sacrifice'. Labour is the very essence of humanity. We are alive because we work and only the de@d is incapable of working. The end of work is productivity. It is productivity that leads to satisfactory provision of goods and services and wealth creation. It is, therefore, the path to national and individual prosperity.' He also advised workers to continue to support the present administration in its 'drive to rev up the vehicle of governance and make all the people of Nigeria derive maximum benefit from the nation'. On the forthcoming Eid-Al-Fitr celebration, the minister extended his congratulations to Muslim for successfully completing the month of Ramadan. 'The self-restraint, self-denial, sacrifice and deep spiritual consciousness that accompanied the fasting period should not end but be maintained and improved upon, in order to be a better person and true worshipper,' he said. He also assured Nigerians that the government is making efforts to ensure that security challenges are addressed, just as he commended security agencies for 'the successes recorded in the fight against criminals across the country and the peace that has returned to the formerly embattled places'.",

Sharing via his Twitter handle, the man @__TheUnsullied mentioned that he went to Shiloh to pray and beg God to heal his woman but in the end, she still died. According to him, he met her during NYSC and she came to change the trajectory of his life. Expressing his grief, he wrote 'The woman I am in Love with is dead. This is unbelievable. It better be a dream. I went to Shiloh because of this. I prayed, I begged. I was going to show her this in a year's time because I was so certain we'd beat this. This woman changed the trajectory of my life. Can't even put into words the impact she had in my life. I was calling and there was no response so I figured she'll probably just call me back. Lose someone to sickle cell one year and another year lose another person to cancer. I am tired man, let everything just end. I've known her for 7 years and I was in love from the very first time I saw her during Nysc. Going back to read all our conversations on all the messaging apps we were communicating on. My eyes are empty from all the tears I've cried. We shared dreams, we had plans. We talked almost everytime. She was always putting me on to opportunities. She was always there for me. I need one more moment, there are things I need to say to her, need to tell her again, need to see her smile and hear her laugh again. Dear Lord you've taken so many of my people, I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life.''",

Speaking during a media visit to Daily Trust office in Abuja on Monday February 21, the Minister said the Federal Government's decision to sanitise social media is hinged on confessions of some money ritual suspects. Lai Mohammed said:- 'Many have also blamed Nollywood for featuring money rituals in some of its movies, saying this has negatively influenced the vulnerable youth. To mitigate this, I have directed the National Film and Video Censors Board, the body set up to regulate the film and video industry in Nigeria, to take this issue into consideration while performing its role of censoring and classifying films and videos. 'I have also directed NFVCB to engage with stakeholders in the film industry in order to express the concerns of the government and Nigerians on the need to eschew money ritual content in their movies.'",

This degenerated into rowdiness at the domestic airport (MM1) leaving passengers scheduled for morning flights stranded. The irate passengers also complained that the airline refused to give them food or water.

A video shared online shows men and women with their children in lorries and also on motorcycles as they fled with their belongings. Over the weekend, the terrorists attacked Dusai village, which is a few kilometers away from Kontagora town on Sunday afternoon, February 6, while Kuimo, which is close to Rijau gown was attacked around 4 pm on the same day, allegedly killing over 44 persons including a blind. The fear of more attacks from the bandits has caused the villagers to flee their homes. One of the fleeing residents who gave her name as Fal'ai Danladi said as she was running, she fell several times and injured her fingers, however, she was helped to Rijau by a motorist. Another fleeing resident from Warare community, Aliyu Bello said that he decided to run because he knew that if he were abducted, it won't be easy on him. He said that all of them in the community have deserted the community due to fear of attack adding that while some found their way to Rijau, others ran into the bushes and rocks to hide. Confirming the recent attack, the chairman of Rijau Local Government Council, Bello Bako, said he and his officials are working out ways to ensure that the fleeing residents get somewhere to stay. The state government or the police is yet to comment on this recent development.",
